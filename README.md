# ScoutBadge
This app is designed to help scouts mainatain their achievements electronicaly. It also allows the scout master insight
into the scouts' progress as well as maintain records.
It will maintain database access so when there is not cellular service, the accumulation of badges can continue and will synch
when back in service. 

Next step would allow parental access and sharing with troup members as well as associating to BSA so all documentation will be
electronic and BSA will have the information.
